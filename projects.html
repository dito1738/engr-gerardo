                <p>This print began by me modifying the nametag file for it to say my name. It was relatively simple to click on the name and replace it with mine. Changing the font and size of the name on the nametag was also relatively straightforward and only had to worry about the name hitting the edges of the nametag.</p>
                <p>Considering this was my first print ever, there were some caveats to the process. I realized after the print that I missed the manual color change. In the future, I know to look for the color change command in the slicer (indicated by the orange bar on the vertical slider) and to be ready to swap the filament when the printer pauses and chirps. Another thing I forgot to do was to eject the USB stick before unplugging it which risked the printing file to be corrupted. I then made a mental note to remember to eject the USB stick before unplugging it.</p>
                <p>While I didn't change the print speed or infill density, I did ensure PrusaSlicer was set to the Prusa MINI+ with the 0.4mm nozzle (Input Shaper) profile as what was required by the guidelines for the project. This didn't need any support considering there were no overhangs that needed to be supported.</p>
                <p>The print quality at the end turned out really good, one small thing is how the letters of my name turned out. If you look closely, you can see the stringing where the nozzle would move over to a different part of the name. Perhaps if I turned the speed down the name would be close to 100% clearer. Also, it’s really unique to see the lines that were made by the printer.</p>

                                            <p><p>
    My second print was a dice, which served as a "torture test" for the printer. This project was a significant learning experience regarding bed adhesion. Initially, I attempted to print a complex Millennium Falcon model which resulted in a "mangled mess," and my first attempt at the die also failed to stick to the build plate.
</p>

<p>
    To solve this, I utilized <b>PrusaSlicer</b> to add a <b>brim</b> to the model. This extra layer of material around the base provided the necessary surface area to keep the print secure. I used the 0.20mm QUALITY setting on the Prusa MINI+, and the final result was successful with clean edges and clear pips on the die.
</p>

<h3>Print #3: Functional Device (Soda Can Opener)</h3>

<p>
    For my final print, I chose a soda can opener. I selected this specifically to solve a problem for my family members who struggle to open cans. This print reinforced my understanding of <b>design for manufacturing</b>; the model was designed to be printed without any supports.
</p>

<p>
    I spent time analyzing the orientation in the PrusaSlicer "slice" tab. I realized the specific rotation it was downloaded in was intentional to ensure the leverage arm printed cleanly without extra material. I tested the device as soon as I got home, and it worked perfectly as intended. It was rewarding to see a 3D modeled object translate into a useful, everyday tool.
