                <p>This print began by me modifying the nametag file for it to say my name. It was relatively simple to click on the name and replace it with mine. Changing the font and size of the name on the nametag was also relatively straightforward and only had to worry about the name hitting the edges of the nametag.</p>
                <p>Considering this was my first print ever, there were some caveats to the process. I realized after the print that I missed the manual color change. In the future, I know to look for the color change command in the slicer (indicated by the orange bar on the vertical slider) and to be ready to swap the filament when the printer pauses and chirps. Another thing I forgot to do was to eject the USB stick before unplugging it which risked the printing file to be corrupted. I then made a mental note to remember to eject the USB stick before unplugging it.</p>
                <p>While I didn't change the print speed or infill density, I did ensure PrusaSlicer was set to the Prusa MINI+ with the 0.4mm nozzle (Input Shaper) profile as what was required by the guidelines for the project. This didn't need any support considering there were no overhangs that needed to be supported.</p>
                <p>The print quality at the end turned out really good, one small thing is how the letters of my name turned out. If you look closely, you can see the stringing where the nozzle would move over to a different part of the name. Perhaps if I turned the speed down the name would be close to 100% clearer. Also, it’s really unique to see the lines that were made by the printer.</p>

                <p>For my torture test, I wanted to pick something unique. I found a Millennium Falcon print intended as a torture test. Considering I am a novice, I didn’t immediately realize what was wrong with the file. The model had several holes which I thought were by design. I didn’t change anything or add supports, and I hit print. After checking the first layer, I came back 5 minutes later to a mangled mess of red filament.</p>
                <p>I asked the TA, and even he was confused, though he suggested adding a “raft” to help adhesion. Even with the brim, he wasn't convinced, so he sent me to the professor. The professor didn't even look at my screen for a second before saying it wouldn't print, he immediately identified that the geometry was too complex for a standard print without advanced supports.</p>
                <p>I pivoted to a model of a 6-sided die. There were no edits made to this model; I just exported the G-Code. Just like the last print, I watched the first layer before leaving. Five minutes later, I came back to another mangled mess, the bottom hadn't stuck. Remembering the earlier advice, I added a brim in PrusaSlicer, which is a flat layer attached to the base to improve adhesion to the plate. This time, the print succeeded.</p>
                <p>The only defects were on the side with the number “3” (where the brim was attached) and the top surface, which wasn't as smooth as the sides.</p>
                <p><b>Technical Insight:</b> Through this process, I learned the difference between file formats. The torture tests were <b>.STL files</b>, which only contain the shape without unit or color data. In contrast, the nametag from Part 1 was a <b>.3MF file</b>, which packages the 3D model with manufacturing data like materials and specific printer settings.</p>

                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Project #3 - Soda Can Opener</h2>
                <p>What made me choose this particular “device” was a memory of my girlfriend and mom struggling to open a soda can with their new nails. I also remembered that my grandparents would struggle to open a soda can as well. These moments led me to pick a device that uses leverage to easily pull on the soda can lid for a pain-free experience. Since I wanted to choose something I could try out myself, I tested it as soon as I got home from the classroom. The device worked perfectly as intended, and I can now easily imagine my grandparents using a customized version for their daily use.</p>
                <p>When it came to the technical side, I didn't have to mess with the settings at all for this build. I used PLA, and the model was designed to be printed without any support, which made the process very straightforward.</p>
                <p>However, I did spend some time messing around with how the model laid on the PrusaSlicer slice tab. I was curious why the model came downloaded in that specific rotation and not another. After looking at it, I realized the orientation was intentional to make sure it could print cleanly without needing extra support material, so I kept it as-is to ensure the best result.</p>
